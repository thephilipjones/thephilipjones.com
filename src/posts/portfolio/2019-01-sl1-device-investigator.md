## What is going on with this device?!

Devices are the core of SL1. (Check out the Dashboards diatribe for more on SL1, and how I took over Device Management.)

One of the easiest way to describe our software to a layperson: "what the IT guy uses to see why the site is broken, and how to fix it". When everyone owned their own datacenters, this was easier, but we have impressively kept up with the dominance of cloud tech, and monitor your AWS just as well as your box of VMs.

So, if you see a device, say a server, go red on your screen, you investigate it. And that's why you're looking at the Device Investigator saying "What is going on with this device?!"

### One page to rule them all.

Which version is this?!

Prebuilt Dashboard or Metrics Browser.
Summary tab vs Performance tab.

Can the Investigator do both? Only to some degree.

### Lessons...

### The Symposium sizzle
