## It was time.

I created the first version of this site in 2014/2015. I built it on the new hotness of the time: single-site generators. Jekyll, Gulp, Bower.

I learned a lot about web development that you can only really understand by drawing Pepe Silvia diagrams trying to connect the dots together.

I haven't really touched it since then, and I needed to set up the dev environment on my shiny new MacBook Pro. In the spirit of continuous improvement, I wanted to rethink what I was communicating anyway.

It's 2021, and I did _not_ want to rely on Ruby anymore. (And I did _not_ want to admit that I used to use jQuery.) I wanted to prioritize the Portfolio, and minimize the Resume.

I spent several hours learning the latest and greatest and settled on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) and [JAMstack](https://jamstack.com). I setup NPM through my newly [customized ZSH]() and deployed []() for the initial template. I customized a little of everything to learn how it all fit together. Really enjoying learning Tailwind, PostCSS, and Nunjucks after these few years .

So, here it is. Building a Portfolio site as a portfolio exercise. How meta.
