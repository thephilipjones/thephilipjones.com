## It was time.

I created the first version of this site in 2014/2015. I built it on the new hotness of the time: single-site generators. Jekyll, Gulp, Bower.

I learned a lot about web development that you can only really understand by drawing Pepe Silvia diagrams trying to connect the dots together.

It's 2021, and I did _not_ want to install Ruby on my shiny new MacBook Pro. I spent several hours learning the latest and greatest and settled on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) and [JAMstack](https://jamstack.com).
