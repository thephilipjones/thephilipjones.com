_This site has been rebuilt into the one you're looking at now._

## Showoff.

I created the first version of [thePhilipJones.com](https://thephilipjones.github.io) in 2014/2015. I built it on the new hotness of the time: single-site generators. Jekyll, Gulp, Bower.

I learned a lot about web development that you can only really understand by drawing Pepe Silvia diagrams trying to connect the dots together.

So, leaving this here for posterity. My first Portfolio site as a portfolio exercise. How meta.
