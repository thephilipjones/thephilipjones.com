## The dashboards guy.

I was sought out by ScienceLogic's HR and UX teams for my experience with dashboards. Since then, I've spent five years designing, prioritizing, and refining the data visualization narrative of ScienceLogic's "New UI" transformation.

SL1 is an endlessly extensible *platform*, and the Service Provider customers like it that way. It sucks in all sorts of data, collected from all types of devices. It produces events and derives status, especially in layers of business-value abstractions.

We serve internal customers, SMEs who deliver dashboards for each hybrid cloud technology, as well as Professional Services who customize and deliver to spec. My team is responsible for the building blocks that enable users to answer questions. 

### Sources and views. 

Data "sources" closely mirrors the customizable data model . The "views" are the visualizations. "Filters" are pluggable, and "selections" connect widgets together.

Ever since our small team's design sprint laid the core foundation and basic concepts, we've layered features and added widgets. I'm proud of the completely modular system that gets the most flexibility our of our development dollar.

### Directions

I have been gathering feedback from a diverse set of stakeholders on the . I outlined a set of different narratives and capabilities, different types of dashboards that could suit different customer needs and use cases. Should we become the best at operator troubleshooting devices, or executives keeping half an eye on a TV showing the status of their business? 

For now we are focusing on summary data, as well as reporting basics like a scheduled emailed export.

### I've learned
