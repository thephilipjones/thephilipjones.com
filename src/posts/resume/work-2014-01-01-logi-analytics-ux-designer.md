_End-to-end product development. Learning, designing, building, testing, repeat._

Designed user interfaces:

- Designed at <strong>Sketch level</strong> with <span class="skill">whiteboards</span> and directed stakeholder conversation
- Designed at <strong>Wireframe level</strong> with <span class="skill">Balsamiq</span> and <span class="skill">Powerpoint</span> and <span class="skill">Keynote</span>
- Designed at <strong>Mockup level</strong> with <span class="skill">Sketch</span> and <span class="skill">Illustrator</span>
- Designed at <strong>Prototype level</strong> with <span class="skill">Axure RP</span> and <span class="skill">HTML/CSS/JS frameworks</span>

Established best practices:

- Utilized <strong>psychology background</strong> to ensure <span class="skill">Gestalt visual structure</span> and <span class="skill">information architecture</span> paradigms are
  satisfied
- Utilized <strong>design background</strong> to ensure <span class="skill">color relationships</span> and <span class="skill">typography hierarchy</span> are intuitive
- Utilized <strong>web-native background</strong> to ensure <span class="skill">content strategy</span> needs and platform expectations are met

Managed product and feature development:

- Engaged with product managers in <span class="skill">Agile</span> methodology
- Wrote <span class="skill">epics</span> as feature plans to capture stakeholder wishes and satisfy user needs
- Broke epics into <span class="skill">user stories</span> to explain complex interactions and functionality to the smallest level
- Managed day-to-day decision-making in a hands-on fashion by sitting among developers answering detail-oriented questions and producing assets on-the-fly where needed

Built front-end architectures from scratch:

- Created <span class="skill">LESS framework</span> to allow easy customer theme customization
- Created <span class="skill">AngularJS directive templates</span> to simplify document structure and make other developers&rsquo; lives easier

Designed and analyzed user tests to validate product directions:

- Gathered participants in a <span class="skill">user community</span> database
- Screened participants using <span class="skill">UserTesting.com</span> to pluck quality testers from millions of less-qualified applicants
- Designed tests from an <span class="skill">experimental psychology</span> background, particularly using the <span class="skill">HEART framework</span>
- Analyzed user tests by listening to talk-aloud feedback and watching for tiny subconscious actions to confirm or reshape hypotheses
- Reported user test findings in slide decks and videos to capture major takeaways, anywhere from a developer or executive level of detail

Elicited product needs through user research:

- Discovered user intentions through the <span class="skill">&ldquo;Job-to-be-Done&rdquo;</span> methodology during <span class="skill">requirements gathering</span>
- Discovered stakeholder intentions through <span class="skill">interviews</span> and <span class="skill">competitive analysis</span>
- Connected the dots with <span class="skill">persona development</span> to satisfy goals and motivations while avoiding specific frustrations
